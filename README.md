# ComputationFinalProject
The final project for course computational political science. Here my project is about the spatial network analysis using networkx and osmnx

./Codes has two files finalproject.py and speed_cal.py. The first one is used for calculation and visualization of spatial networks while the second one is used for imputing missing values of maxspeed for driving.

./Figures include the figures generated from the codes.

./slides is the Slides for presentation.
